Bioinformatician at the [CRG](http://www.crg.eu/) in the [group of Miguel Beato](http://www.crg.eu/en/miguel_beato) and in the [4DGenome](http://www.crg.eu/en/content/research/4dgenome-erc-synergy-project) project. I work with genomics data but interested in data science in general. This site is meant to be a ragbag of code explained, best practices, howtos, etc. mostly related to bioinformatics.
