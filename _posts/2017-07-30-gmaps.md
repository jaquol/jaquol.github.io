There was Matt again staring at the text message Josh had just sent him. "Al Mahara. July 30th @ 8:00 pm", it only read.

Matt and Josh met during their PhD studies and they have been very good friends ever since. After the PhD, Matt got a job as bioinformatician. Josh founded a start-up company which eventually was sold to a big company for an immense amount of money. After the sale, deep-pocketed Josh decided to travel around the world for one year or two.

Josh did not forget Matt though. Every now and then, Matt would receive a text message only containing a few words. It was Josh revealing the name of the restaurant he was inviting Matt for dinner and the time of the meeting. It could be anywhere in the world, Josh would pay for all the travel expenses. All Matt need to find out was the location of the venue and be there at the agreed time. Accordingly, Matt opened his computer and wrote "Al Mahara" in [Google Maps](https://www.google.es/maps). "Dubai here I go!", Matt thought.
