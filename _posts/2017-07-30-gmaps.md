There he was Matt again staring at the text message Josh had just sent him. "Al Mahara. July 30th @ 8:00 pm", it only read.

Al Mahara. July 30th @ 8:00 pm

Matt and Josh met during their PhD studies and they have been very good friends ever since. After the PhD, Matt got a job as bioinformatician. Josh founded a start-up company which eventually was sold to a big company for an immense amount of money. After the sale, deep-pocketed Josh decided to travel around the world for one year or two.

Josh did not forget Matt though. Every now and then, Matt would receive a text message only containing a few characters. It was Josh revealing the name of the restaurant he was inviting Matt for dinner and the time of the meeting. It could be anywhere in the world, Josh would pay for all the travel expenses. All Matt need to find out was the location of the venue and be there at the agreed time. Accordingly, Matt opened his computer and wrote "Al Mahara" in [Google Maps](https://www.google.es/maps). "I love this game. Dubai here I go!", Matt thought.

As he is flying to Dubai, Matt thinks that Josh's game, in essence, reminds him of one of his common tasks as bioinformatician. Every now and then he also receives a text file with _a few_ characters that do not make much sense on their own.

```
GCTAGGGGGTGGCGCTAGCCAGGCGACGCGCTTTAAGCCGCGGGCTCTC
```

These do not correspond to the name of any restaurant but to the sequence of a small bit of the human genome [1], which is made of several strings each containing millions of mixed A, C, G and T characters. As happened with "Al Mahara", Matt needs to find out the location of the "GCTAGGGGGTGGCGCTAGCCAGGCGACGCGCTTTAAGCCGCGGGCTCTC" sequence in the genome if he wants to make sense of it. Akin to Google Maps, Matt has dedicated tools to quickly and confidently determine the genomic location of such type of sequences in a process known as alignment or mapping.



The parallelisms with Google Maps searches do not end here.



[1] current reads are 75-150 characters long, shorter than a Tweet; reference to longer reads: they are long but less accurate.
