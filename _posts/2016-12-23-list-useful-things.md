This is meant to be a frequently updated and never-ending list of tools/sites that have made my work analysing data much easier.


**2. Jupyter notebook extensions**

[Jupyter notebook extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions) add very useful functionalities to your Jupyter notebooks. Installation is very straightforward and so it is turning them on/off.

**1. HTML-converted Ipython notebooks without code**

One of the things I really like about using [Ipython notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) (now Jupyter notebooks) is that as you perform the analyses --if these are well documented-- you are simultaneously generating a ready-to-send report. Especially if combined with [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert), which allows you to convert from the Jupyter notebook format (`*.ipynb`) to formats (e.g. `*.html`, `*.pdf`) which can be opened without having [Ipython](http://ipython.org/) installed; the final report is even nicer if one uses the `--to slides` option. My satisfaction was incomplete because most of the users to whom I typically send the reports do not care about the code used to generate the results (i.e. plots, tables, statistics) and, therefore, the code cells really interfered the reading. Luckily I found this solution from [Hannes Bretschnieder](http://hannes-brt.github.io/blog/2013/08/11/ipython-slideshows-will-change-the-way-you-work/).
